Final commit - have finished all the pages and done a tidy up of the code because I was dumb and didn't have the browser extended all the way, which meant some touch ups were necessary. Also gave me a chance to see areas in the core code I hadn't updates in some files yet. While I do prefer having multiple css files, this was definately a downside to the process, especially when you're trying to figure out different bugs in the code and have 3 pages to also fix it in.

A few elements of the site are responsive, such as most of the text and things like that. I'd definately wante to refine this more if not for time constraints.

Definately enjoyed getting more familiar with html/css. I think in the future I'd spend more time perfecting certain core elements on a single css page before starting to duplicate them; it would save a lot of time and stress with having to debugg across multiple pages.

I think the site itsself, while fairly user friendly and easy to navigate - can obviously always improve. Perhaps for a real website, using the little help symbols to give mini tutorials with a skip button so students have that option to fast track forward.
