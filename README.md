For this first commit - or technically second after the initial one to set up the repository - I mainly wanted to create all the necessary pages that I'd be working with and basically just get everything started. Theres 7 pages in total that I'll be working on, as seen in my prototype:

- Language Select (this will be the index.html).
- Landing.
- Discussion Board.
- Social.
- History.
- Culture.
- Account.

At this stage I'm planning to use a single css file. I did a little research and thought that it'd probably be the best route, though if it looks otherwise later on than I'll probably ask for the tutors/lecturers help and opinions on it. At thi stage I'm mainly just looking to split things up into grids and start getting the basic elements onto the page and in the semi-correct positions.
I've also gone ahead and downloaded the fonts specified in my Design Style sheet in the previous hand-in. In retrospect I could've done myself a favour and used fonts already available, but they were just the ones I liked on Figma. I think I'll have to use @font-face to use these - I've only done a small amount of research on the best method so I think I'll impliment them later on.
