Finished the navigation bar and sorted out the search bar, account, and wishlist hyperlinks. Took a while to properly align the icons and also to get everything in the correct order. Because I used 'float' for the nav bar it meant if I wanted to float something to the right (search bar + icons), then I'd have to reverse the order in .html to show it correctly. Fairly simple but took me far to long to fix. Positioning the icons was a struggle as well.

I sorted out the select dropdowns and was able to finishe the opening language select page - also resized some elements and adjusted the composition a little.
Left to develop is the remainder of the discussion board page - mainly just compositon and adding in the country conversation blocks - and also the accounts page. Both of these have their own .css as well so I need to copy the core code from the other .css files.
