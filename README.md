Alot in this commit (not very good at commiting, in between long work sessions.)
- Made adjustments to some of the compositon and selected font sizes.
- Finished the social page.
- Began the culture page (just need to resize images).
- Finished the core code for the footer, some of the body, and part of the header.
 *Note>>> The 'core code' is what I'm calling the key, repeated sections of code - this includes the header (nav, input, etc.), footer (language, terms), and some of the body code (page dependent).
