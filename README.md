Today I worked on some basic buttons. I've worked with them before in other classes but haven't created them from scratch before so I found the tutorial to be the most helpful and straight forward. I also decided to use the RGB values for my colours instead of hex, just because I found it easier to impliment the changes in opacity with RGB because the value can just be added to the end.

I've also added in the fonts using @import and URL's. I found this to be the most reliable and straightforward way, especially because Google Fonts has a section that generates the necessary code for HTML and CSS to add in. Implimented these accordingly as well as the text shadow.

I've been playing around with the language select menu/button and seeing if I can make it work nicely without Javascript, but haven't had much success so far so will most likely come back to it later.
